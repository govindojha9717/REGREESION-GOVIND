        "\n",
        "Overfitting (Too Much Flexibility) As the degree increases, the model becomes more complex and starts fitting noise instead of the true pattern.\n",
        "This results in poor generalization to new data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: A degree-10 polynomial may fit training data perfectly, but perform terribly on test data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Computational Complexity Adding higher-degree terms and multiple variables creates a large number of features.\n",
        "This increases the training time and can cause numerical instability.\n",

        "Loss of Interpretability In higher-degree models, it's hard to understand or explain what each term is doing.\n",
        "Interpretability is important in many domains (e.g., healthcare, finance). 4. Extrapolation is Dangerous Predictions outside the range of training data can be wildly inaccurate.\n",
